      <p>
        My throat contracts, my heart clenches tight,<br>
        Each time I think of you at night.<br><br>

        Your voice still lingers in my ear,<br>
        Softly calling, "baby, darling."<br><br>

        "I love you," you once said,<br>
        Now echoes in my aching head.<br><br>

        But my heart keeps asking why —<br>
        If you meant to leave, why did you try?<br><br>

        All those midnight talks we shared,<br>
        All the mighty confessions bared,<br>
        All the dreams we once held close,<br>
        Now faded, lost like ghostly prose.<br><br>

        The silence fills the empty space,<br>
        A hollow ache I can't erase.<br><br>

        What once was bright, now turned to grey,<br>
        A love that quietly slipped away.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem explores the soft afterlife of love — the space between remembrance and release. 
        It captures how memory can still speak in whispers long after words have ceased. 
        The imagery of fading light and echoing silence reflects grief not as drama, but as a gentle erosion. 
        Love doesn’t always end with a storm — sometimes it simply dims, leaving behind the quiet ache of what once was. 
        Through that silence, the poem finds its peace — a final lullaby to what was once everything.
