        Maybe it's the what ifs,<br>
        Maybe it's the maybes,<br>
        Maybe it's the "it's not you, it's me,"<br>
        Maybe it's the timing,<br>
        Maybe it's the fate... the destiny.<br><br>

        Maybe it's everything that went wrong,<br>
        Or maybe —<br>
        It was never meant to be right.<br>
        Never meant to last long.<br><br>

        Maybe it was just our delusion,<br>
        Maybe love was just a season —<br>
        A chapter filled with promises —<br>
        Promises we couldn't keep,<br>
        Promises that still echo your name,<br>
        Promises that make me miss you,<br>
        More than I want to admit.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem explores impermanence — the truth that not all love stories are meant to endure, yet all leave traces.
        It accepts that some connections exist only for a season, to teach, to transform, to warm us before the cold.
        The “maybes” become a meditation on uncertainty — not regret, but gentle acknowledgment of fate’s design.
        It reminds us that love’s value isn’t measured by duration, but by the tenderness it leaves behind.
