      <p>
        You asked me to wait...<br>
        but waiting was never a language I knew.<br>
        I thought love was movement, not silence.<br><br>

        You could have stayed.<br>
        You could have chosen me.<br>
        But instead, you chose to leave.<br><br>

        And still — that song I once sang<br>
        as your lullaby cuts me open when it plays.<br><br>

        All those nights we talked?<br>
        They're the nightmares that won't let me sleep.<br><br>

        You made me addicted —<br>
        to your voice, to your presence, to you.<br><br>

        So addicted that it aches not to listen to you.<br>
        It aches not to be able to be with you.<br>
        It aches to 'love' you.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem explores the haunting permanence of what’s unsaid — the echoes left behind when love departs but never truly disappears.
        It captures how absence can be louder than presence, how memory becomes an involuntary ritual.
        The speaker’s ache isn’t for the person alone, but for the silence that followed — the void that now holds all their noise.
        In this quiet, we see love transformed: no longer shared, but still deeply alive, pulsing within the stillness.
