      <p>
        If you had to leave,<br>
        Why did you come at all?<br><br>

        Like thunder chasing the fall,<br>
        You shook my soul — then let it crawl.<br><br>

        You stole my heart without a sound,<br>
        Whispered, "I'm yours — your everything."<br>
        But what kind of everything<br>
        Is so easy to leave with nothing?<br><br>

        Was it love, or just a passing thrill?<br>
        A fleeting fire you never meant to fill?<br><br>

        You held my hand just long enough<br>
        To leave fingerprints on my trust —<br>
        Fingerprints that wouldn't fade,<br>
        Fingerprints that wouldn't fade,<br>
        Traced in every tear I've made.<br><br>

        Fingerprints that ache to see,<br>
        Etched in every part of me.<br><br>

        Still... those fingerprints taught me to believe —<br>
        To believe in better,<br>
        To believe in truth,<br>
        To believe in who I was before you.<br><br>

        And yet, I miss you.<br>
        And yet, my silence spills.<br><br>

        And yet,<br>
        I write of you.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem captures the aftermath of love — when the echoes of someone’s presence become the ink of one’s healing.
        The “fingerprints” symbolize what remains when love fades: memory, lesson, and transformation.
        Through pain, the speaker rediscovers creation — writing not to reach the lost, but to understand the self.
        It is an ode to resilience, where loss no longer silences, but inspires.
        Writing becomes both the wound and the cure — proof that something beautiful can still emerge from what once broke you.
