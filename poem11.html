      <p>
        I loved you with everything in me,<br>
        every pulse of my heart beating your name,<br>
        every breath holding a prayer for you.<br><br>

        And yet, you kicked it away —<br>
        not gently, not accidentally,<br>
        but with the force of someone<br>
        who never cared where it landed.<br><br>

        Tell me, how true was your *I love you*<br>
        if you could laugh without me,<br>
        smile without thinking of me,<br>
        live without knowing of me.<br><br>

        I am here, crying into my pillow<br>
        while you sleep in peace,<br>
        living in a world where I am nothing more<br>
        than a story you've already closed.<br><br>

        I loved you —<br>
        but maybe my love was too soft,<br>
        too tender for a heart like yours.<br><br>

        Was it you who failed to see me?<br>
        Or was it me who believed you ever did?

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem reflects the quiet devastation of unreciprocated love — the ache of giving everything and realizing it was never enough to be remembered the same way. 
        It questions where the fault lies: in the lover who couldn’t see, or the one who loved too deeply. 
        The truth the poem reveals is bittersweet — that love’s purity does not guarantee permanence. 
        Still, even in heartbreak, there is dignity in feeling deeply. To love so fully, even when unseen, is its own kind of strength.
