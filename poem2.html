      <p>
        They say eyes don't lie.<br><br>

        Maybe that's why I've always looked there first —<br>
        searching for truth, for stories, for pieces of people<br>
        they never meant to show.<br><br>

        Those brown ambered eyes shining in the sunlight.<br>
        Those deep blue eyes holding and expressing emotions deeper than the ocean.<br><br>

        Those cat eyes which always carry mischievous intentions in them.<br>
        Those green eyes which look deeper than the forest in the dark.<br><br>

        Those grey eyes sparkling despite all the greys in their lives.<br>
        Those hazel eyes, a mixture of green and brown,<br>
        seeming like a living canvas of day and night.<br><br>

        Those black eyes — no matter how pitch dark they are,<br>
        they never fail to speak volumes.<br><br>

        And in all their colors, quiet truths reside,<br>
        Soft echoes of the lives they try to hide.<br><br>

        No need for words, no need for sound —<br>
        Their stories in a single gaze are found.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem explores the gaze as a mirror of truth — the idea that eyes betray what words conceal.
        Each color becomes a metaphor for experience, emotion, and identity.
        It reminds us that every glance holds a universe: unspoken stories shimmering beneath silence.
        To see deeply is an act of compassion — and perhaps, the closest we come to understanding another soul.
