      <p>
        I still remember our conversations —<br>
        They are a constant ring in my ear.<br><br>

        I still remember our favourite place —<br>
        It is the constant peace to my eyes.<br><br>

        I still remember your messy hair —<br>
        My hands tangled in them while your laughter<br>
        resembling a melody.<br><br>

        I still remember that dimple on your right cheek —<br>
        Which is as rare as the bioluminescence.<br><br>

        I still remember your longing gaze —<br>
        Which got me lost every single time.<br><br>

        I still remember your warmth —<br>
        Wrapping me like a burrito.<br><br>

        I still remember your voice —<br>
        Replaying in my mind frequently.<br><br>

        I still remember the way you used to say my name —<br>
        Making my heart twitch and stomach tingle.<br><br>

        I still remember your unaligned teeth —<br>
        Which compliment you the most.<br><br>

        I still remember our strolls —<br>
        Making me feel you everywhere.<br><br>

        I still remember your cologne —<br>
        A mixture of cinnamon and sandalwood.<br><br>

        I still remember your handwriting —<br>
        Making me re-read our notes.<br><br>

        I still remember the way your eyes twinkle when you like something —<br>
        Making me want to present it right in front of you.<br><br>

        I still remember it all —<br>
        Every detail etched in time,<br>
        A love so vivid, so endless,<br>
        Yet now, only mine.<br><br>

        I still reach for echoes of you,<br>
        In the breeze... in the night —<br>
        But memories are all I hold,<br>
        Fading soft like morning light.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem is an ode to remembrance — the act of loving through memory when presence has been lost.
        Every remembered detail becomes an anchor against time’s erosion, a rebellion against forgetting.
        It teaches that memory is both sanctuary and wound: a place where what’s gone still breathes, softly, through recollection.
        To remember is to love again — even in absence.
