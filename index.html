    <h2>Featured Poem: <em>From a soul... to that Now stranger</em></h2>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        I trusted you with everything-<br>
        only for you to toss it away like nothing.<br>
        I called you my confidant,<br>
        but I was only a passing name in your story.<br>
        The laughter we shared<br>
        now haunts my days, echoes through my <br>
        nights.<br>
        That friendship I thought was gold<br>
        was just a façade<br>
        a mask you wore until you got what you<br>
        wanted,<br>
        a lie I kept believing,<br>
        a dream I still wish was real.<br>
        My heart aches<br>
        to see your face and stay silent,<br>
        to watch your name blink in my inbox<br>
        and not type back,<br>
        to stare at your contact on my screen<br>
        and still not call.<br>
        Tell me<br>
        was it that easy<br>
        for you to let go?

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem reflects the pain of betrayed trust — when genuine emotion meets calculated indifference.It explores how attachment creates illusions, making lies feel like love and masks seem real.The speaker’s silence symbolizes the conflict between longing and self-respect.It questions whether emotional bonds are ever truly mutual or just projections of our own hope.Ultimately, it’s a meditation on how letting go reveals who truly cared — and who never did.
