      <p>
        You came like a storm,<br>
        Wrecked me up, Left me at the bay.<br><br>

        And yet I am still here,<br>
        Waiting, wanting for you to come back.<br><br>

        The storm left, the sky's cleared.<br>
        But my heart didn't.<br><br>

        The silence around me echoes your voice,<br>
        As I keep on replaying it.<br><br>

        The laughter, the words,<br>
        And the meaning behind them.<br><br>

        But all of it now, is just shadows and lost warmth,<br>
        Left me cold.<br><br>

        And in that cold, I wrap myself in memories —<br>
        Memories of you, Of us,<br>
        Memories I would always remember.<br><br>

        Even if you never return,<br>
        Even if you've forgotten,<br>
        Those memories will never leave me.<br><br>

        As I carry them quietly,<br>
        Like the waves carry the moonlight —<br>
        Never touching, But never letting go.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem contemplates what remains after love has passed — the afterglow of connection, preserved in fragments of memory. 
        It reflects on how remembrance itself becomes a form of love: a silent devotion that endures without needing presence. 
        The waves and moonlight symbolize longing and restraint — closeness that never fully meets, yet never fades. 
        To remember, here, is to hold both grief and grace in the same tender breath.
