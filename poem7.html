        Like the sun that rose.<br>
        like the waves that shimmer.<br>
        like the moon that shines.<br>
        like the stars that twinkle.<br><br>

        Here I go again —<br>
        not all light, but flickering still,<br>
        like warmth through clouds,<br>
        like laughter at dusk,<br>
        like the hush of the tide returning.<br><br>

        Despite all the blacks and greys,<br>
        here I am —<br>
        with golden and blue,<br>
        soft as a tide,<br>
        quiet as light returning.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem embodies renewal — the persistence of warmth amid exhaustion. 
        It reminds us that healing is not the sudden return of brightness, but the soft endurance of small lights: laughter, peace, memory, breath. 
        Through its imagery of tides and celestial light, it whispers that resilience is not loud — it’s gentle, cyclical, and deeply human. 
        Even in the greys of life, there is always a quiet shimmer waiting to rise again.
