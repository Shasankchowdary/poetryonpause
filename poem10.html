      <p>
        I feel my skin burn,<br>
        heat radiating through every vein,<br>
        the moment I saw you with her.<br><br>

        The moment I saw my everything<br>
        with a random nothing,<br>
        chills ran down my spine.<br><br>

        The moment you held her hand,<br>
        The moment you held her hand,<br>
        everything shattered,<br>
        everything crumbled.<br><br>

        But what about those promises you made?<br>
        The ones that whispered — "it's me or no one."<br><br>

        The promises that kept me breathing,<br>
        that kept me believing...<br><br>

        Until I saw you.<br>
        With her.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem reveals the unspoken violence of heartbreak — not in wounds or words, but in silence. 
        It explores betrayal as both fire and frost: a burn that leaves no scar yet reshapes everything within. 
        The poem reminds us that promises can be fragile bridges, and when they collapse, what remains isn’t rage — it’s the stillness of disbelief. 
        Through that quiet, we see the truth: not every pain announces itself; some simply hum in the silence we’re left with.
