      <p>
        I didn't count the days,<br>
        just the memories — I held on.<br><br>

        I stayed where your presence used to feel close.<br><br>

        I told everyone I was fine,<br>
        but I checked for your message more than once.<br><br>

        You never said you would come back,<br>
        but I waited — like the moon waits for the sun,<br>
        only to realize my sun chose not to rise anymore.<br><br>

        If it ever chose to rise, it would know —<br>
        its moon is still up here, waiting.<br><br>

        And waiting.<br>
        And waiting.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem speaks to the kind of love that doesn’t end — it simply outlives its reason. 
        It mirrors the eternal rhythm of the moon and sun: always connected, never together. 
        Waiting becomes both devotion and punishment, a ritual that keeps the heart alive while breaking it. 
        In the stillness of longing, the poem finds grace — the quiet beauty of those who love even without return.
