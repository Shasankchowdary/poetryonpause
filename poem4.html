      <p>
        You say it's for my best —<br>
        what best is that which makes me suffer?<br><br>

        You say, "it's not you, it's me,"<br>
        but it's me with the bleeding soul.<br><br>

        A love so pure and immortal, you said —<br>
        and yet too heavy for you to carry.<br><br>

        You spoke of a future for us<br>
        with no practical present.<br><br>

        You whispered forever,<br>
        but your hands never stayed long enough to build a moment.<br><br>

        I loved you like I love the ocean —<br>
        wrote your name in wet sand,<br>
        watched it vanish before the tide even touched it.

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem explores the paradox of love that promises eternity yet fades in silence. 
        It examines how words can shimmer like devotion but dissolve when not anchored in action. 
        The ocean metaphor becomes the heart of it — love as something vast, beautiful, but impossible to hold. 
        In its quiet unraveling, the poem captures the grief of understanding that sincerity and permanence are not the same.
