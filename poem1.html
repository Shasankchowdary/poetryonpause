        If I could turn back time<br>
        I would've never let you go<br><br>

        If I could turn back time<br>
        I would've held on to you as tight as possible<br><br>

        I would've stopped you<br>
        I would've compelled you<br>
        Maybe even threaten you<br><br>

        But that's not how it works, right?<br><br>

        So I had to let you go<br>
        I had to loosen my hold on you<br><br>

        And I would do anything to do otherwise

      <h3>The Philosophy Behind This Poem</h3>
      <p>
        This poem reflects on the ache of unrealized control — the human wish to rewrite the past, to resist endings that feel premature. 
        Yet, beneath the longing, there’s acceptance: a realization that love’s truest form is not in possession but in surrender. 
        Like petals in the rain, beauty remains even as it fades — fragile, fleeting, and profoundly human.
